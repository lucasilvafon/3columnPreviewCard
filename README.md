## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this challenge, I put into practice some of the knowledges I've been studying, like semantic HTML5 markup, style props, but mostly CSS Flexbox, which I used for the whole positioning on this landpage.

### Continued development

I am really looking forward studying about CSS Grids for most CSS comprehension. And, also dive into JS.

### Useful resources

- [FLEXBOX FROGGY](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)
- [CSS TRICKS - COMPLETE GUIDE TO FLEXBOX](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

This both websites helped me a lot through the whole process.
